# Installation & Usage

The Magic Mirror can be installed manually or using automatic installers. At the start of 2020 the decision was made to remove the automatic installer from the MagicMirror² core repository and move it to a community-maintained separate repository. For more infomation about this desision, please check issue [#1860](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror/issues/1860) on GitHub.

Therefore the only officially supported way of installation is by using a [manual installation](#manual-installation). Using external installation scripts is at your own risk but can make the process a lot easier. Available automatic installers can be found under: [alternative installation methods](#alternative-installation-methods).

## Manual Installation

1. Download and install the latest *Node.js* version:
- `curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo -E bash -`
- `sudo apt install -y nodejs`
2. Clone the repository and check out the master branch: `git clone https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror`
3. Enter the repository: `cd MagicMirror/`
4. Install the application: `npm install`
5. Start the application: `npm start` \
   For **Server Only** use: `node serveronly` .

::: tip Raspbian Buster
If you are running Raspbian Buster you will need to upgrade Electron. This can be done by running the following command from within your MagicMirror folder:
```
npm install electron@6.0.12
```
(This will be fixed in 2.11.0)
:::

::: warning NOTE
The installation step for `npm install` will take a very long time, often with little or no terminal response! For the RPi3 this is **~10** minutes and for the Rpi2 **~25** minutes. Do not interrupt or you risk getting a :broken_heart: by Raspberry Jam.

## Alternative Installation Methods
The following installation methods are not maintained by the MagicMirror² core team. Use these scripts and methods at your own risk.

### Automatic Installation Scripts

- Sam (@sdetweil, long time contributor of the MagicMirror² framework) maintains a easy to use installation and update script: [https://github.com/sdetweil/MagicMirror_scripts](https://github.com/sdetweil/MagicMirror_scripts)
- [The MagicMirror Package Manager](https://github.com/Bee-Mar/mmpm) is a command line interface designed to simplify the installation, removal, and maintenance of MagicMirror modules.

### Docker Image
- MagicMirror² in server only mode can be deployed using [Docker](https://docker.com). Head over to the [MagicMirror Docker GitHub repository](https://github.com/bastilimbach/docker-MagicMirror) for more information.

## Usage

Note the following:

- `npm start` does **not** work via SSH. But you can use `DISPLAY=:0 nohup npm start &` instead. \
  This starts the mirror on the remote display.
- If you want to debug on Raspberry Pi you can use `npm start dev` which will start MM with *Dev Tools* enabled.
- To access toolbar menu when in mirror mode, hit `ALT` key.
- To toggle the (web) `Developer Tools` from mirror mode, use `CTRL-SHIFT-I` or `ALT` and select `View`.


### Server Only

In some cases, you want to start the application without an actual app window. In this case, you can start MagicMirror² in server only mode by manually running `node serveronly` or using Docker. This will start the server, after which you can open the application in your browser of choice. Detailed description below.

::: warning IMPORTANT
Make sure that you whitelist the interface/ip (`ipWhitelist`) in the server config where you want the client to connect to, otherwise it will not be allowed to connect to the server. You also need to set the local host `address` field to `0.0.0.0` in order for the RPi to listen on all interfaces and not only `localhost` (default).
:::

```javascript
var config = {
	address: "0.0.0.0",	// default is "localhost"
	port: 8080,		// default
	ipWhitelist: ["127.0.0.1", "::ffff:127.0.0.1", "::1", "::ffff:172.17.0.1"], // default -- need to add your IP here
	...
};
```


### Client Only

This is when you already have a server running remotely and want your RPi to connect as a standalone client to this instance, to show the MM from the server. Then from your RPi, you run it with: `node clientonly --address 192.168.1.5 --port 8080`. (Specify the ip address and port number of the server)
